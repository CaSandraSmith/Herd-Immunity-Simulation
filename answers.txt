1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, 
percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
I used the provided example of:
Population Size: 100000
Vaccination Percentage: 90%
Virus Name: Ebola
Mortality Rate: 70%
Reproduction Rate: 25%
People Initially Infected: 10

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point
before the virus burned out?
The simulation ended because every living person was vaccinated
so 100% of the population was infected at some point.

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?
69.9% of the population died from the virus.

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation,
how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
3094951 times a vaccination saved someone from potentially becoming infected.
